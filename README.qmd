The goal of peerest is to ...

Estimate peer effects in high-dimensional networks

## Installation

You can install the development version of peerest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Salema-DG/ptmap")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
library(ptmap)
## basic example code

library(dplyr)
data(qp_nut2_data) # load wage data from Portugal at NUT2 level

# create a tibble with only one year, 2019.
df19 <- qp_nut2_data %>%
 filter(year == 2019)

# Apply the function
map_pt_19 <- df19 %>%
 map_pt_nuts_II(main_var = mean_real_wage,
                nut2_var = nut_2_est,
                nut_var_qp = T)
```

```{r}
# can the figure show up?
map_pt_19
```
